# Mathematics for Machine Learning (2025)

This repository contains course materials for the **Mathematics for Machine Learning** module, part of the **MSc in Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovation** at Imperial College London. The course is delivered in the **Autumn term**.

---

## Course Description

This module develops a foundation for the mathematical theory underpinning key ML methods, which are necessary for their understanding and analysis.  

The module covers six units â€” **Linear Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, Optimisation, Probability, and Statistics** â€” to establish a comprehensive setting that strengthens studentsâ€™ understanding of widely used ML models and methods.  

Emphasising both **theory and practice**, the moduleâ€™s assessment consists of:  
- **Two courseworks** (20% each)  
- **Final exam** (60%)
